    "# Using LLM-powered retreival and reranking - (Titan LLM + Bedrock Titan embedding)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing LLM-driven retrieval has the potential to yield more pertinent documents compared to retrieval based on embeddings. However, this advantage comes at the expense of increased latency and expenses. We will demonstrate that employing embedding-based retrieval initially, followed by a secondary retrieval stage for reevaluation, can offer a balanced solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent surge in applications involving \"Develop a chatbot using your data\" has emerged in the past several months. This trend has been facilitated by frameworks such as LlamaIndex and LangChain. Many of these applications rely on a standard approach known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG):\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A vector store is employed to store unstructured documents (knowledge corpus).\n",
    "2) When presented with a query, a retrieval model is utilized to fetch relevant documents from the corpus, followed by a synthesis model that generates a response.\n",
    "3) The retrieval model retrieves the top-k documents based on the similarity of their embeddings to the query. It's important to note that the concept of top-k embedding-based semantic search has existed for over a decade and doesn't involve the use of LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utilization of embedding-based retrieval offers numerous advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dot product calculations are swift and don't necessitate model invocations during query processing.\n",
    "* Although not flawless, embeddings can effectively capture the semantics of documents and queries. There's a subset of queries for which embedding-based retrieval yields highly relevant outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, embedding-based retrieval can exhibit imprecision and return irrelevant context for the query due to various factors. This subsequently diminishes the quality of the overall RAG system, irrespective of the LLM's quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing this challenge is not novel; existing information retrieval and recommendation systems have adopted a two-stage approach. The initial stage employs embedding-based retrieval with a higher top-k value to maximize recall while accepting a lower precision. Subsequently, the second stage utilizes a somewhat more computationally intensive process characterized by higher precision and lower recall (such as BM25) to \"rerank\" the initially retrieved candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delving into the shortcomings of embedding-based retrieval would require an entire series of blog posts. This current post serves as an initial exploration of an alternative retrieval technique and its potential to enhance embedding-based retrieval methodologies.\n",

    "### LLM Retrieval and Reranking\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM Retrieval and reranking strategy employs the LLM to determine the document(s) or sections of text that align with the provided query. The input prompt comprises a collection of potential documents, and the LLM is entrusted with choosing the pertinent group of documents while also assigning a score to gauge their relevance using an internal measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explain how to approach the retriever pattern of LLM-powered retrieval and reranking using Amazon Bedrock LLM and LlamaIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LlamaIndex\n",
    "LlamaIndex is a data framework for your LLM application. It provides the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Offers data connectors to ingest your existing data sources and data formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.)\n",
    "* Provides ways to structure your data (indices, graphs) so that this data can be easily used with LLMs.\n",
    "* Provides an advanced retrieval/query interface over your data: Feed in any LLM input prompt, get back retrieved context and knowledge-augmented output.\n",
    "* Allows easy integrations with your outer application framework (e.g. with LangChain, Flask, Docker, anything else).\n",
    "* LlamaIndex provides tools for both beginner users and advanced users. Our high-level API allows beginner users to use LlamaIndex to ingest and query their data in 5 lines of code. Our lower-level APIs allow advanced users to customize and extend any module (data connectors, indices, retrievers, query engines, reranking modules), to fit their needs.\n",

The question became could we offer customers auseful service where they could get meaningful value before we had all the features we thought they wanted?We decided that the initial launch of EC2 could be feature-poor if we also organized ourselves to listen tocustomers and iterate quickly. This approach works well if you indeed iterate quickly; but, is disastrous if youcan’t. We launched EC2 in 2006 with one instance size, in one data center, in one region of the world, withLinux operating system instances only (no Windows), without monitoring, load balancing, auto-scaling, oryes, persistent storage. EC2 was an initial success, but nowhere near the multi-billion-dollar service it’sbecome until we added the missing capabilities listed above, and then some.<br>In the early days of AWS, people sometimes asked us why compute wouldn’t just be an undifferentiated<br>commodity. But, there’s a lot more to compute than just a server. Customers want various flavors of compute(e.g. server configurations optimized for storage, memory, high-performance compute, graphics rendering,machine learning), multiple form factors (e.g. fixed instance sizes, portable containers, serverless functions),various sizes and optimizations of persistent storage, and a slew of networking capabilities. Then, there’sthe CPU chip that runs in your compute. For many years, the industry had used Intel or AMD x86 processors.We have important partnerships with these companies, but realized that if we wanted to push price andperformance further (as customers requested), we’d have to develop our own chips, too. Our first generalizedchip was Graviton, which we announced in 2018. This helped a subset of customer workloads run morecost-effectively than prior options. But, it wasn’t until 2020, after taking the learnings from Graviton and<br>innovating on a new chip, that we had something remarkable with our Graviton2 chip, which provides up to40% better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86 processors.

And, while Graviton2 has been a significant success thus far (48 of the top 50 AWSEC2 customers have already adopted it), the AWS Chips team was already learning from what customerssaid could be better, and announced Graviton3 this past December (offering a 25% improvement on top ofGraviton2’s relative gains). The list of what we’ve invented and delivered for customers in EC2 (and AWS ingeneral) is pretty mind-boggling, and this iterative approach to innovation has not only given customersmuch more functionality in AWS than they can find anywhere else (which is a significant differentiator), butalso allowed us to arrive at the much more game-changing offering that AWS is today.<br>Devices : Our first foray into devices was the Kindle, released in 2007. It was not the most sophisticated<br>industrial design (it was creamy white in color and the corners were uncomfortable for some people to hold),but revolutionary because it offered customers the ability to download any of over 90,000 books (nowmillions) in 60 seconds—and we got better and faster at building attractive designs. Shortly thereafter, welaunched a tablet, and then a phone (with the distinguishing feature of having front-facing cameras and agyroscope to give customers a dynamic perspective along with varied 3D experiences).</td>\n",

In 2008, AWS was still a fairly small, fledgling business.We knew we were on to something, but it still required substantial capital investment. There were voicesinside and outside of the company questioning why Amazon (known mostly as an online retailer then) wouldbe investing so much in cloud computing. But, we knew we were inventing something special that couldcreate a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future. We had a head start on potential competitors;and if anything, we wanted to accelerate our pace of innovation. We made the long-term decision tocontinue investing in AWS. Fifteen years later, AWS is now an $85B annual revenue run rate business, withstrong profitability, that has transformed how customers from start-ups to multinational companies to publicsector organizations manage their technology infrastructure.

It’s also hard to spend enough time on the newinitiatives when there’s resource contention with the more mature businesses; the surer bets usually win out.Single-threaded teams will know their customers’ needs better, spend all their waking work hours inventingfor them, and develop context and tempo to keep iterating quickly.</td>\n",
